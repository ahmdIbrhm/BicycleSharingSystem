# BicycleSharingSystem

# Abstract

In this project we provide a service based on semantic web technologies where we can add open data from any source about bicycle sharing services in cities, convert the data into a unique model, provide visualization for this data.We conisder a fixed model for such services, we convert the provided data to RDF format using a pre-designed tool that accepts parameters about how it is structured which could be fairly diverse from source to source. The processs can be run in the background to dump the real-time data into the database (triple store) so that we will have an up-to date data visualization(website) and also we keep track about the station states where everything is available for statistical issues.The process could fail due to the fact that we could a huge diversity where it have some limitations described more precisely in the scope.
